# Problem A: Sanji The Gentleman

## Statement:

Sanji is a formidable fighter. Sanji's wrath befalls men without mercy. Yet he would sooner face death than harm or lay a finger on a woman. The epitome of chivalry, a true gentleman, right? He can manage a whole army but he would suffer a lot if faced with a woman.

If you are a man, Sanji will give you hell. However, even if it means killing him, Sanji would never lay a finger on a woman. A true, nice Gentleman, right? Yeah, until the crew is attacked and among the enemies, there is some very dangerous and scary woman. Sanji is very strong and would manage an army by himself unless there is a woman in the army then he is screwed. Usopp uses his binoculars to scout the enemy troupes and wants to know whether he needs to send Nami with Sanji or if Sanji will manage by himself.

Given the list of the genders of the enemies, tell Usopp if he needs to send Nami too or not.
## Input :
The first line contains a string **S** (1 ≤ length(S) ≤ 100000) — the list of the genders of the enemies: 'W' for woman, 'M' for man.

## Output :
Output "YES" without quotes if they should send Nami. Otherwise, output "NO"
