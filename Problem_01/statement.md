# Problem A: Sanji The Gentleman

## Statement:
If you are a man, Sanji will give you hell. However, even if it means killing him, Sanji would never lay a finger on a woman. A true, nice Gentleman, right? Yeah, until the crew is attacked. Sanji is very strong and would manage an army by himself unless there is a woman in the army then he is screwed. The Strawhats crew are used to this fact, so, they would send Nami with him if they were sure there is at least one woman in the army so he doesn't get beaten to death.

Usopp uses his binoculars to scout the enemy troupes and wants to know whether he needs to send Nami with Sanji or if Sanji will manage by himself.

Given the list of the genders of the enemies, tell Usopp if he needs to send Nami too or not.
## Input :
