# Problem A: Teach Kid Luffy How To Count 

## Statement:
Monkey D. Garp, the Marines Hero, noticed that his grandkid Luffy can't count how much the groceries cost. Turns out little luffy doesn't know how too add nor multiply numbers.
Garp is a busy old man so he couldn't teach his grandkid so he wants you to teach him how.
Luffy would give you an operation that you need to evaluate for him.
Help luffy out with this task.

## Input :
one line that contains the first number ***N***, the operation ***OP*** which is either ***'+'*** for addition or ***'*'*** for multiplication, and the second number ***M*** $1\le N,M \le 10^9$ <br>

## Output :
Output The result of this operation. 

**Be aware of integer overflow. Use a 64-bit integer datatype if you're using Java or C or C++ (long for java,  long long for C and C++ and  %lld). The int data type is a 32-bit integer with a maximum value of 2147483647**
