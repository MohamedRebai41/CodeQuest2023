        Monkey D. Luffy, the main character of “One Piece,” is known for his
        love of food, particularly meat.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be given a string consisting of the characters
        ‘<strong>.</strong>’, ‘<strong>#</strong>’ and ‘<strong>|</strong>’:<br />
        ‘<strong>.</strong>’ is an empty spot, ‘<strong>#</strong>’ is a piece
        of meat and ‘<strong>|</strong>’ is a wall. This string represents a
        <strong>1D</strong> grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luffy needs to choose a starting point and a walking direction(left or
        right) such that he maximizes the meat eaten.
      </p>
      <p>So he asked for your help.</p>
      <p>
        Your goal is to put Luffy in one of the empty spots in order to maximize
        the meat eaten such that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Luffy can move in only 1 direction in the grid(left or right), in
            other words he can’t change his direction after choosing it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Luffy will stop if he finds a wall or the edge of the grid.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is guaranteed that the grid contains at least one empty spot.</p>
      <h2 id="input-">Input :</h2>
      <p>
        The first line of input contains a single integer
        <strong>T</strong> (1≤T≤100) — the number of test cases. Then the test
        cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first line of each test case contains an integer
        <strong>n</strong> (1≤n≤10<sup>6</sup>) — the length of the string
      </p>
      <p>
        The second line of each test case contains a string
        <strong>s</strong> of length <strong>n</strong>, consisting of
        characters ‘<strong>#</strong>’, ‘<strong>.</strong>’,
        ‘<strong>|</strong>’.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is guaranteed that the sum of <strong>n</strong> over all test cases
        doesn’t exceed 10<sup>6</sup>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="output-">Output :</h2>
      <p>
        For each test case, output the maximum quantity of meat Luffy can get.
      </p>
