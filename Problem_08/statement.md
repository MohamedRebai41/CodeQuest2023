
# Statement 
The Straw Hat Pirates, composed of **k** members **including their captain** , are eagerly anticipating a festive celebration, and their chosen delight for the occasion is pies. Each pie is segmented into **x** pieces. However, their captain, Monkey D. Luffy, has a formidable appetite and will eat up to **y** pieces all by himself. 

The Straw Hat Pirates are not really good with math, so they ask for your help to decide the minimum number of pies they need to buy to satisfy all the crew members' appetites. 
# Input 
- The first line contains a single integer **T** $(1≤T≤1000)$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each testcase consists of a single line which contains three space separated integers: 
 x $(1 ≤ x ≤ 10^4)$ – the total number of pieces in each pie, y $(0 ≤ y ≤ 10^4)$ – the number of pieces Luffy intends to eat alone and  k $(1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4)$ – the total number of crew members. 
# Output 
Output a single integer – the minimum number of pies the Straw Hat Pirates need to order.
